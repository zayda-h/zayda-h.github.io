          <h2> Alice, the first all-electric passenger airplane, prepares to fly </h2>
          <p> The Alice, a plane developed by Israeli company Eviation, went through engine testing last week, and according to the Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay, 
		  the Alice is just weeks away from its first flight. The nine pasenger Alice will be able to fly for one hour, or 440 nautical miles. The company
		orginally aimed for Alice to take flight before 2122, but poor weather conditions in the Pacific Northwest hindered testing.</p>
          <p> Growing electric aviation startups and established aviation companies and donations to those copmapies (if any): </p>
          <ul>
            <li>NASA gave $253 million to GE Aviation and magniX to bring the technology to the US by 2035.</li>
            <li>Boeing is investing $450 in Wish Aero, who is building an all-electric, autonomous, passenger aircraft.</li>
	    <li>Airbus has been working on its own electric aviation endeavours since 2010.</li>

It does so while being sustainable, and through being economically viable," said Bar-Yohay.
