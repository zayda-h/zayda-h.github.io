          <h2> Alice, the first all-electric passenger airplane, prepares to fly </h2>
          <p> The Alice, a plane developed by Israeli company Eviation, went through engine testing last week, and according to the Eviation CEO Omer Bar-Yohay, 
		  the Alice is just weeks away from its first flight. The nine pasenger Alice will be able to fly for one hour, or 440 nautical miles. The company
		orginally aimed for Alice to take flight before 2122, but poor weather conditions in the Pacific Northwest hindered testing.</p>
          <p> Growing electric aviation startups and established aviation companies and donations to those copmapies (if any): </p>
          <ul>
            <li>NASA gave $253 million to GE Aviation and magniX to bring the technology to the US by 2035.</li>
            <li>Boeing is investing $450 in Wish Aero, who is building an all-electric, autonomous, passenger aircraft.</li>
	    <li>Airbus has been working on its own electric aviation endeavours since 2010.</li>
	  </ul>  
	<p>Electric aviation proponents predict Alice and electric planes like it becoming as commonplace as any other means of transportation. <cite>"It really integrates aviation into the fabric of transportation, of our commuter life. It does so while being sustainable, and through being economically viable," said Bar-Yohay. "Once we start seeing planes like this, the entire way we look at where we live, how we commute, how we go on vacation, will change. It will be a high-speed train without the rail." </cite></p>
